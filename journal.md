Journal 1:
6/26
To get started with this I spent some time learning the software as well as the in's and out's of the software, getting acquanted with it. (Mostly spent looking up tutorials and looking up "what is a gpio mean") After a bit I had started to get used to the software KiCAD (Open source yippee :D) as well as redownload Fusion 360, there was a bit of a hangup on fusion though seeing as I didn't have the minimum amount of hard drive space, but I freed up some space and it's all good now.
6/27
FUSION TIME WOOOOO
I was really used to blender for 3D modeling as well as how it handles the viewport, Fusion 360 is kinda the opposite of how it handles things (Specifically viewport controls and how it handles verticies, edges, and faces)
It was a bit of a pain at first but eventually I got used to it. Something I found difficult while modeling was trying to get the measurements right (Roughly an hour and 30 minutes of the second half of the livestream shows that) I was able to overcome that hurdle as well and overall everything's coming together pretty well!
