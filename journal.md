### 6/26  
**Time Spent: 5 Hours 37 Minutes**

To get started with this I spent some time learning the software as well as the in's and out's of the software, getting acquainted with it. (Mostly spent looking up tutorials and looking up "what does GPIO mean")  
After a bit I had started to get used to the software KiCAD (open source) as well as redownload Fusion 360. There was a bit of a hangup on Fusion though, seeing as I didn't have the minimum amount of hard drive space, but I freed up some space and it's all good now.

I was really used to Blender for 3D modeling as well as how it handles the viewport. Fusion 360 is quite the opposite in how it handles things—specifically viewport controls and how it treats vertices, edges, and faces.  
It was a bit of a pain at first, but eventually I got used to it. Something I found difficult while modeling was trying to get the measurements right. (Roughly an hour and 30 minutes of the second half of the livestream shows that.) I was able to overcome that hurdle as well, and overall everything is coming together well.

# 6/27 (again)
**Time Spent: 3 Hours 20 Minutes**

Had to redo the whole project since the original blueprint for the file used a different microcontroller (An ATMEGA one which isn't a drop in replacement sadly since the pinout is wildly different.) So Ive spent the past couple of hours redoing both the CAD and PCB files. Took way less time this time since I already knew which dimensions to take down and what tolerances I should use.

Oddly enough when switching back to the RP2040-DIP the layout for everything became way less convoluted which was great, I'm starting to get how most of this works and how the row/column system works which was a big hurdle for bigger things.
